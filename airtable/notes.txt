Notes:
1. Would like to implement deeper comparison methods on everything -- does not exist currently.

Conflict resolution strategies:
For Move -- The strategy is to apply changes from the clients one by one. Basically try to keep track
of what the client's original intent was and re-apply that to the server. 

For syncing data back to client -- I am currenlty copying the entire data again. Better way to do this
is to keep track of changes since last time the client was online (use UUIDs for the clients for this)
and only sync back those changes using the same SyncAndResolve strategy.
